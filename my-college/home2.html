                    NITW offers a healthy teacher-student relationship. Faculties here are extremely passionate about teaching and guide their students in all sorts of manners. Students are taught according to the latest trend to become industry-ready. Now the total faculty strength at NIT Warangal stands at 342, which is the highest among all 31 NIT's across India. Apart from this nearly 269 Ph.D., (150 Full Time and 119 Part time) Scholars are there to assist professors in labs and project works to gain valuable experience. Last year this institute has taken an initiative where each faculty has been assigned to a small group of students as a mentor. This is indeed an appreciable work from the authority because, now students not only can take advice from faculty regarding studies but also can discuss their other problems with them.
